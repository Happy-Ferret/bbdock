BBDock version 0.2.6 released
	* a switch for a secondary left-button action (command line argument 
	  -l, see bbdock -h)
	* another switch for case-sensitive matching (-c); case-insensitive is 
	  default now
	* support for multiple window-titles for each icon (window-titles 
	  should be seperated by a semikolon).  The 
	  multiple-window-title-feature proves to be a very handy way to 
	  iconify/lower a whole application along with its dependend windows 
	  (like GIMP or Thunderbird).  It works very well if proper configured.
	  There is only one thing that should be noted so far: if you have a
	  window-title containing a ':', use the wildcard '?' instead since you 
	  can't specify ':' in a data field in .bbdockrc (no character escaping 
	  supported right now)
	* some minor bug fixes.  The whole thing changed a bit nevertheless

BBDock version 0.1.4 released
	* more precise version numbering.  Markus decided to switch to the 
	  release.upgrade.update scheme for clarity.  Hence the release before 
	  this one could be called 0.0.9 .
	* important change: the window-titles are now matched exactly (with 
	  wildcards), not as case-insensitive substring. This became neccessary 
	  to avoid misinterpretation of window-titles with filenames or 
	  html-titles in it.  For example, one ~/.bbdockrc could look like 
	  that,
		~/icons/firefox.png:firefox:*Mozilla Firefox
		~/icons/thunderbird.png:thunderbird:*Mozilla Thunderbird
		~/icons/writer.png:soffice -writer:*OpenOffice.org*
		~/icons/gaim.png:gaim:GAIM
	* a corresponding window may now be iconified with a right-click.  The 
	  right-click action can be configured on the command line and can also 
	  lower or close a window.
	* the running-instance-mark comes now in four flavors, the known play-arrow,
	  three little dots, a right-bottom-corner and a little cross wich is 
	  even clickable (closes the application).  Every mark can be moved 
	  within the window by specifiying a left/top (or if negative right/bottom) 
	  margin on the command line (see bbdock -h for details).
	* for advanced (and/or impatient ;-)) users, you may now adjust the 
	  idle time (grey-state) of every icon in a fourth field, see README for a 
	  sample, you may use some keywords here also. Due to integer precision 
	  the given time (in miliseconds) is only an approximation but it 
	  should fit the purpose :-)
	* the possibility to execute an icon remotely; this allows you to 
	  launch some application by a hotkey and still have it bound to some icon, refer 
	  to -x in help
	* X11 copy'n paste support, you may now middle-click any (non-active) 
	  icon to launch it with the clipboard contents as command line 
	  argument, one use of this may be pasting an internet adress over 
	  Firefox or some file over some editor.

BBDock version 0.09 released
	* fixed a little error in the window-raising code


Date: Tue, 08 Mar 2005 21:40:16 +0100
BBDock version 0.08 released
	* fixed an error rendering dark transparent images
	* tested and fixed the 16bit color-depth rendering code
	* added a little arrow in the upper left corner to indicate the 
	  application is already running
	* completed the remote control function (command line argument -i, see 
	  -h) to swap icons (to reflect a change for example)
	* normal (non-exclusive) icons now are tracking their processes while 
	  in grey-state also, this allows the icon to become immediately 
	  available again if the process terminates before the delay has 
	  elapsed


Date: Tue, 08 Mar 2005 01:07:01 +0100
BBDock version 0.07 released
	* now supports exclusive applications and can raise them itself
	* it finally runs silently and modestly in one single process and
	  responses much nicer to clicks
	* I had to change the format of the configuration file a little: use 
	  ':' to seperate icons and commands, not just a number of blanks. This 
	  became neccessary because you might now add a third field:  the 
	  window title; if you like the icon to raise the already running 
	  instance instead of starting a new one. Refer to "bbdock -h" or the 
	  README file for (more) information on this ;-)
