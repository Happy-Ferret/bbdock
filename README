What is bbdock ?

    bbdock displays one or more PNG icons in the BlackBox/FluxBox slit from
    which you can launch the corresponding applications. It is pretty similar 
    in function and appearance to bbbutton which you might want to try if you 
    are reading this on a display with a color-depth below 16 bits.

How to compile

     Since you are reading this I assume you already unpacked the archive into
     some directory.

     ./configure
     make
     su
     make install

     For more options try ./configure --help

     You need X11 libraries & headers and libpng-devel. If anything fails,
     just drop me a line at mf@markusfisch.de ;-)

Configuration

    You may invoke bbdock either with your icons specified on command line
    or simply create a short configuration file (.bbdockrc) in your home
    directory.

    The syntax for a command-line-argument or a line in the configuration
    file is equal:

    IMAGEFILE:COMMAND[:WINDOWTITLE;[:IDLE]]

    IMAGEFILE   - should be path and filename of some PNG icon
    COMMAND     - a script or binary to execute
    WINDOWTITLE - is a semicolon-seperated list of case-insensitive
                  window-titles of corresponding application-windows. Those
                  strings may contain wildcard characters (* and/or ?) to 
                  exclusively identify a window. By providing this list you
                  make the icon exclusive to one instance of course. Clicking
                  on already launched icons will raise the corresponding
                  window instead of invoking a new instance.
    IDLE        - idle time after triggering one icon in miliseconds, instead
                  of using numbers you may also use the terms "lame" (~ 10 s),
                  "slow" (~ 5 s), "fast" (~ 500 ms) or "fastest" (~ 250 ms)

    For example, run it from command line this way:

    $ bbdock "~/.icons/firefox.png:firefox:*Firefox"

    Sample out of a ~/.bbdockrc:

    ~/.icons/terminal.png:xterm::1
    ~/.icons/firefox.png:firefox:*Firefox

    To start by configuration file, just run bbdock. Type "bbdock -h" for
    a detailed view of general options.

Requirement

    The images should be not much greater than 48x48 pixels and must be in 
    PNG format. Use images with transparency to get the most out of it.

    You need libpng-devel to compile this software. The raise-window 
    function is only available to window managers which implement the EWMH 
    specification.

Bugs

    Currently there are only two known bugs you might run into:

    If you're using BlackBox > 0.70 you need to patch it in order to make it
    work correctly. Just insert the following code after line 250 into
    blackbox-0.70.0/src/Slit.cc and recompile BlackBox:

      if ((texture.texture() & bt::Texture::Gradient) && frame.pixmap)
        XSetWindowBackgroundPixmap(display, frame.window, frame.pixmap);
      else if ((texture.texture() & bt::Texture::Solid))
        XSetWindowBackground(display, frame.window,
          texture.color1().pixel(screen->screenNumber()));

    FluxBox < 0.9 may fail to raise applications that are exclusive. Update
    to FluxBox 0.9 to fix this problem.
